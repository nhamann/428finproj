\section*{Design Objective}
The objective of this project was to design and analyze a biquad low-pass digital filter. The filter is an IIR filter that can be represented by:

\begin{equation}
y[n] = -0.1372*x[n-3] + 0.6249*y[n-1] - 0.2667*y[n-2]
\end{equation}
\label{eq:filteq}

The filter input, output and coefficients are 8-bit fixed-point two's complement numbers. All numbers are normalized so that each falls within the range of -1 to +1. The 8-bit two's complement representations of the filter coefficients are shown in Table \ref{tab:filtcoeff}.

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
Coefficient & Decimal & 2's Complement Hex \\
\hline
a1 & -0.1372 & EE \\
\hline
b1 & 0.6249 & 51 \\
\hline
b2 & -0.2667 & DE \\
\end{tabular}  
\caption{Filter Coefficient Representations}

\end{table}

This report documents our approaches to designing the filter. The design was implemented in Verilog, with Model-Sim used to simulate the filter implementation and Xilinx used to analyze the performance of each filter design. Matlab was used to plot filter inputs and outputs.
