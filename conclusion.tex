\section*{Concluding Remarks}
Future design iterations may investigate a Multiplier Accumulator (MAC) implementation in order to simplify the number of modules instantiated. While the hand calculations coincide with simulations on the filter directly, it is possible that the original filter design is flawed and needs to be re-designed. Some unfound logical error may exist in the Verilog code which could be dropping samples and destroying the resolution. At this time, further investigation is required to resolve the strangely unaffected output.
