\section*{Conclusion}
The obvious flaw with the discussed designs is that none of them seem to have achieved any sort of attenuation of high-frequency signal elements. In fact, a glance at the Matlab plots of each filter response reveal a stunning consistency in the inability to actually filter. We were not able to be determined what exactly was the root of this circumstance, but it is likely some fundamental error in the conception of the problem -- a variety of multiplier and adder designs as well as truncation and overflow/underflow handling techniques seemed to have no effect on the high-frequency attenuation. We were able to improve the circuit performance primarily through use of optimized adders and a pipeline implementation, but the filter attenuation resisted such attempts.
